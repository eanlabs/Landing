  "Body": "Honoring the memory of those who passed away is everyone's sacred duty. With the Memoria company, maintenance of the cemeteries in Kyiv becomes careful, timely, and calm. Not only the important dates, such as provodys, anniversaries, memorial days, or the 40-days, require our attention to the burial places. A grave cleaning service is a gesture of respect that helps to keep the cemetery clean and to keep the memory alive in your hearts."
